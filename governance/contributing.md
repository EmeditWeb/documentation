# Contributing to Stellar x402

We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and AI tool creators. Stellar x402 is architected to support over 100+ community tools, payment adapters, and integrations.

## Issue Templates

When opening an issue on GitHub, choose the appropriate structured template:

1. **[Tool Request](https://github.com/stellar-x402-mcp/monorepo/issues/new?template=tool_request.yml)**: Propose a new Horizon or Soroban RPC tool.
2. **[Payment Method Adapter](https://github.com/stellar-x402-mcp/monorepo/issues/new?template=payment_method.yml)**: Propose a new payment rail, liquidity router, or token standard.
3. **[Bug Report](https://github.com/stellar-x402-mcp/monorepo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)**: Report defects with mandatory mapping to the Universal 250 Error Codes Registry.

## Pull Request Standards

Every pull request must satisfy rigorous verification criteria before merging:

### 1. Verification Checklist
- **Unit Tests**: All tests passing (`pnpm test`). Target: 100% pass rate.
- **Smart Contract Tests**: Cargo unit and gas benchmark tests passing (`cargo test`).
- **Strict Typing**: Zero TypeScript errors (`pnpm typecheck`) with `strict: true` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
- **Atomic Commits**: Commits must follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) with multi-line descriptive summaries.

### 2. Resilience Checklist
- Does the tool handle upstream RPC downtime gracefully?
- Are errors mapped to standard error codes from `@stellar-mcp/paywall`?
- Are timeouts and retries bounded with exponential backoff and jitter?

### 3. Gas & Security Checklist
- No private keys or secret seeds logged or serialized.
- State channel operations must benchmark CPU instructions and memory footprints.
- Contract binary size must remain optimized (spec-shaking v2).
